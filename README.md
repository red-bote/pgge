# pgge
Retro 3D game in Java using libGDX, Bullet physics and Entity Component System

Started life as libGDX 3D and Bullet physics demo from "http://bedroomcoders.co.uk/libgdx-bullet-redux-2/". 

pgge is a more-or-less playable attempt to implement the old "Assault Rigs" game. It languished for a while in its previous home at github.com/neiderm. Upgraded installed Android Studio to 2022.3 and re-integrated with latest libGDX setup. Runs on Desktop configuration but the Android target has not been tested in some time.

The default assets do not provide the playable game, but show the 3D Bullet physics demo screen from libgdx-bullet-redux-2 which originally inspired this project.
